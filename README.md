I chose this licence because I want to make a project open, whith shared sources, where you are able to do whatever you want with (inspire, contribute ...) but I also want this to remain a free to play (no pay to play, no pay to win of any kind) and wanted it to be used in non-profit situation.

So feel free to look and share but keep in mind that it should remain free, fair and open.

Yeah, this is not for greedy people.
